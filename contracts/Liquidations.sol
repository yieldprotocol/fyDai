/**
 * @dev The Liquidations contract allows to liquidate undercollateralized weth vaults in a reverse Dutch auction.
 * Undercollateralized vaults can be liquidated by calling `liquidate`.
 * Collateral from vaults can be bought with Dai using `buy`.
 * Debt and collateral records will be adjusted in the Controller using `controller.grab`.
 * Dai taken in payment will be handed over to Treasury, and collateral assets bought will be taken from Treasury as well.
 * If a vault becomes colalteralized, the liquidation can be stopped with `cancel`.
