 * Treasury doesn't have any transactional functions available for regular users.
 * All transactional methods are to be available only for orchestrated contracts.
 * Treasury will ensure that all Weth is always stored as collateral in MAkerDAO.
 * Treasury will use all Dai to pay off system debt in MakerDAO first, and if there is no system debt the surplus Dai will be wrapped as Chai.
 * Treasury will use any Chai it holds when requested to provide Dai. If there isn't enough Chai, it will borrow Dai from MakerDAO.
