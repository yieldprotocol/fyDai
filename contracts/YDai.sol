/**
 * @dev yDai is a yToken targeting Chai.
 * Each yDai contract has a specific maturity time. One yDai is worth one Chai at or after maturity time.
 * At maturity, the yDai can be triggered to mature, which records the current rate and chi from MakerDAO and enables redemption.
 * Redeeming an yDai means burning it, and the contract will retrieve Dai from Treasury equal to one Dai times the growth in chi since maturity.
 * yDai also tracks the MakerDAO stability fee accumulator at the time of maturity, and the growth since. This is not used internally.
 * Minting and burning of yDai is restricted to orchestrated contracts. Redeeming and flash-minting is allowed to anyone.
