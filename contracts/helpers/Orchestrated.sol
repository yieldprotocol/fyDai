 * @dev Orchestrated allows to define static access control between multiple contracts.

 * which would be marked with the `onlyOrchestrated` modifier.
 * During deployment, the contract deployer (`owner`) can register any contracts that have privileged access by calling `orchestrate`.
 * Once deployment is completed, `owner` should call `transferOwnership(address(0))` to avoid any more contracts ever gaining privileged access.
